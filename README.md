# ReCalendar
### Highly customizable calendar for ReMarkable tablets

ReCalendar allows you to generate your own, personalized calendar using PHP and the [mPDF library](https://mpdf.github.io/).

## How does it look?

See it in action: https://youtu.be/tz32lR51rqw and check more [screenshots](SCREENSHOTS.md). Example [generated PDF](https://github.com/klimeryk/recalendar/raw/main/example/ReCalendar.pdf) version and the [`local.config.php`](https://github.com/klimeryk/recalendar/blob/main/example/local.config.php) that generated it.

## Features

 - Optimized for the [ReMarkable 2 tablet](https://remarkable.com/store/remarkable-2) (should work with version 1 as well) to use the full space available and minimize screen refreshes.
 - Heavy use of links to allow quick and easy navigation.
 - Lots of easy configuration options to tailor the calendar to your needs - plus access to the source code for even more advanced customization.
 - Easily switch to any locale supported by PHP.
 - Add extra pages to all or selected days of the week to suit your needs.
 - Provide a list of special dates (anniversaries, birthdays, etc.) and let ReCalendar embed them into your personalized calendar - on monthly views, weekly overviews and finally, day entries.
 - Track your habits monthly.

## Quickstart

Dependencies:

- PHP
- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)

On MacOS, you can quickly install them with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/): `brew install php composer`.

Then fetch the newest code from this repository - the easiest way is to download the [ZIP archive of it](https://github.com/klimeryk/recalendar/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).

Go to the folder where you unzipped/cloned the repository and run:

```
composer install
php generate.php
```

After a few seconds you should have your very own `ReCalendar.pdf` calendar generated in the same directory.

## Configuration

You can easily override the configuration defaults by creating a new file called `local.config.php`. Here's a short example that changes the year to 3000, adds some weekly TODOs and special dates:

```php
<?php

namespace ReCalendar;

class LocalConfig extends Config {
  protected function get_configuration() : array {
    return array_merge( parent::get_configuration(), [
      self::YEAR => 3000,
      self::SPECIAL_DATES => [
        '04-05' => [ 'May The Fourth Be With You' ],
	'24-12' => [ 'Christmas' ],
      ],
      self::WEEKLY_TODOS => [
        'Plan week',
	'Send the weekly email',
      ],
    ] );
  }
}
```

See the [`config.php`](https://github.com/klimeryk/recalendar/blob/main/config.php) file for the full list of available options and their descriptions. You can modify the options there as well, but it's recommended to use the `local.config.php` instead as then you can easily update the source code in the future and retain your configuration changes.

There's also an [example generated PDF](https://github.com/klimeryk/recalendar/raw/main/example/ReCalendar.pdf) you can check out quickly and the [`local.config.php`](https://github.com/klimeryk/recalendar/blob/main/example/local.config.php) that generated it as an inspiration.

## Advanced configuration example

This is an example configuration for the Polish language (my native language), showing how you might want to approach it yourself, for your language.

```php
<?php

namespace ReCalendar;

class LocalConfig extends Config {
  protected function get_configuration() : array {
    return array_merge( parent::get_configuration(), [
      // See `locale -a` if your locale is supported
      self::LOCALE => 'pl_PL.UTF-8',
      // Override the month names, because the Polish locale
      // has them declined, but I prefer them like this
      self::MONTHS => [
        1 => 'Stycze≈Ñ',
        2 => 'Luty',
        3 => 'Marzec',
        4 => 'Kwiecie≈Ñ',
        5 => 'Maj',
        6 => 'Czerwiec',
        7 => 'Lipiec',
        8 => 'Sierpie≈Ñ',
        9 => 'Wrzesie≈Ñ',
        10 => 'Pa≈∫dziernik',
        11 => 'Listopad',
        12 => 'Grudzie≈Ñ',
      ],
      // Some habits I want to track
      self::HABITS => [
        'Jogging',
        'Hobby',
        'KsiƒÖ≈ºka',
      ],
      // These will be shown on each week overview
      // to help me plan the week.
      self::WEEKLY_TODOS => [
        'Odkurzyƒá mieszkanie',
        'Zaplanowaƒá wycieczkƒô',
      ],
      self::WEEK_NAME => 'Tydzie≈Ñ',
      self::WEEK_NUMBER => 'T#',
      self::DAY_NAMES_SHORT => [
        'Pn',
        'Wt',
        '≈ör',
        'Cz',
        'Pt',
        'So',
        'Nd',
      ],
      self::DAY_ITINERARY_ITEMS => [
        self::DAY_ITINERARY_COMMON => [
          [ 21, '', ],
          [ 2, 'One act of kindness', ],
        ],
        // You can use day of the week numbers (4 being Thursday here)
        // to override the itinerary items for those specific days.
        4 => [
          [ 21, '', ],
          [ 3, 'One act of kindness', ],
          // Adding more than ~24 lines forces a new page to be created
          // You can use that to add an additional page for days you
          // need to write more
          [ 28, 'Notes from session', ],
        ],
        self::DAY_ITINERARY_WEEK_RETRO => [
          // Just give me 24 lines, without any text
          [ 24, '' ],
        ],
        self::DAY_ITINERARY_MONTH_OVERVIEW => [
          [ 3, 'Main goal', ],
          [ 13, 'Notes', ],
        ],
      ],
      self::SPECIAL_DATES => [
        '14-03' => [ 'Pi Day' ],
        '25-12' => [ 'Christmas' ],
	// Note that you can, of course, have more than one item per day:
	'04-05' => [ 'Star Wars Day', "Will Arnett's birthday" ],
      ],
      self::WEEKLY_RETROSPECTIVE_BOOKMARK => 'Podsumowanie',
      self::WEEKLY_RETROSPECTIVE_TITLE => 'Podsumowanie tygodnia',
    ] );
  }
}
```

## Update

Just run `php generate.php` any time you need to regenerate the calendar after config changes. If you want to update the `recalendar` source code, either use `git pull` or download the newest ZIP archive and override all the files (make sure you're using the `local.config.php` approach, as described above).

**NOTE**: The update process is mostly for when you're tweaking your configuration and/or generating a calendar for the next year. Due to how ReMarkble tablet works, you can't easily "migrate" your notes from your previous version of the calendar/file to the new one. To the tablet, it's a new, "empty" file. You can select and copy notes from each page individually and move them over, but that's very cumbersome.
